To further prove the ability of the DNA nano-structure, this year we used four DNA strands to form a DNA nano-structure to detect the presence and the concentration of Lactobacillus instead of just a gene fragment of a bacterium. We successfully designed nano- triangular bipyramid applicable to the bacterium using Tiamat. We then successfully detect the presence and concentration of bacteria by measuring its peroxidase activity.",

This method can be used as a `green pesticide` which doesn`t damage the environment. The agrobacteria can transfer part of its plasmid into plant genome, which is the T-DNA. We inserted the chitinase gene into the vector pCAMBIA 2301 and adopted a binary system. We first let the vector amplify in E.coli DH5. Then, we extracted the plasmids and inserted them into agrobacteria tumefacien GV3101.

We try to express the signaling proteins of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Escherichia coli: LuxN, LuxO, and LuxU and integrate them with dCas9 system that regulates GFP expression. It is expected that when the Vibrio parahaemolyticus level is high, it would produce enough autoinducer molecules to be detected by LuxN and induces the cascade of the system until GFP is expressed.

   "Abstract": "Polyethylene terephthalate, PET, formed by condensation and polymerisation of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), is one of the most commonly used polyesters in the world. The degradation rate of PET is significantly slow which make them extremely persistent and hard to dispose. Although PETase can biologically degrade PET, the rate of enzymatic reaction is not suitable for usage in plastic waste treatment. Therefore, creating mutants which have a higher PET degradation activity may represent an effective and a long term solution of pollution from PET. After structural studies of PETase and its mutants, we hypothesized a more hydrophobic surface and narrower substrate binding site could lead to an increase in activity due to a better substrate interaction with PET. In our study, four single or double PETase mutants are produced and their PET degrading capacity are measured by enzyme activities for para-nitrophenol (pNP)-aliphatic esters.",

To increase the efficiency of the enzyme expression, we determined the best combination of some constitutive promoters and RBS.

   "Abstract": "Diphtheria, a lethal disease caused by the toxigenic strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, afflicted Indonesia in /10 mortality rates upon 593 national cases. Complicated diagnostic method and ambiguous symptoms were the main obstacles in giving the optimal treatment, according to physicians. Therefore, a fast and convenient novel approach to enhance diagnostic precision is needed to mitigate diphtheria immediately. In regards, our team focuses on developing the diagnostic tool using K-12 chimeric bacteria and green fluorescent protein (GFP) to enable a rapid detection of Diphteria toxin upon binding. This novel technology is claimed to be fast, available, and easy-to-usewhich sets stepping stones regarding to the establishment of primary diagnostic tool for Diphtheria toxin worldwide. In addition, we aim to prevent future outbreaks using public education to enhance awareness regarding anti-hoax movements and introduce daily probiotic consumption to encounter low usages of probiotic in Indonesia",
