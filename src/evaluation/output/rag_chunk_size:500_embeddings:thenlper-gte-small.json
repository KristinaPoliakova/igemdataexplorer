    "Abstract": "Polyethylene terephthalate, PET, formed by condensation and polymerisation of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), is one of the most commonly used polyesters in the world. The degradation rate of PET is significantly slow which make them extremely persistent and hard to dispose. Although PETase can biologically degrade PET, the rate of enzymatic reaction is not suitable for usage in plastic waste treatment. Therefore, creating mutants which have a higher PET degradation activity may represent an effective and a long term solution of pollution from PET. After structural studies of PETase and its mutants, we hypothesized a more hydrophobic surface and narrower substrate binding site could lead to an increase in activity due to a better substrate interaction with PET. In our study, four single or double PETase mutants are produced and their PET degrading capacity are measured by enzyme activities for para-nitrophenol (pNP)-aliphatic esters.",

This novel technology is claimed to be fast, available, and easy-to-usewhich sets stepping stones regarding to the establishment of primary diagnostic tool for Diphtheria toxin worldwide.

In this project we have established an improved PET degradation system. First, we utilized point mutations with enhanced PET degradation, and implemented a light inducible promoter to regulate the expression of PET-degrading enzymes more effectively. To increase the efficiency of the enzyme expression, we determined the best combination of some constitutive promoters and RBS.

Therefore, creating mutants which have a higher PET degradation activity may represent an effective and a long term solution of pollution from PET. After structural studies of PETase and its mutants, we hypothesized a more hydrophobic surface and narrower substrate binding site could lead to an increase in activity due to a better substrate interaction with PET. In our study, four single or double PETase mutants are produced and their PET degrading capacity are measured by enzyme activities for para-nitrophenol (pNP)-aliphatic esters.",

The effort of reducing plastic in the environment is being made by various fields, however due to the high cost of plastic treatment and its harmful side products a breakthrough is yet to be made. In this project we have established an improved PET degradation system. First, we utilized point mutations with enhanced PET degradation, and implemented a light inducible promoter to regulate the expression of PET-degrading enzymes more effectively. To increase the efficiency of the enzyme expression, we determined the best combination of some constitutive promoters and RBS. Not only that, we used a new signal peptideto increase the amount of secreted enzymes. From these results, we constructed a circulating incubator in which PET is degraded by transgenic E.coli.",

   "Abstract": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus, an emerging pathogen of white shrimp that cause White Feces Disease (WFD), still poses major threat in white shrimp industry. Unfortunately, Vibrio parahaemolyticus is hard to detect; shrimp farmers tries to estimate its existence through physicochemical and traditional parameterswhich does not always give accurate prediction. We design Escherichia coli that could detect Vibrio parahaemolyticus in shrimp pond water and estimates its quantity. We try to express the signaling proteins of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Escherichia coli: LuxN, LuxO, and LuxU and integrate them with dCas9 system that regulates GFP expression. It is expected that when the Vibrio parahaemolyticus level is high, it would produce enough autoinducer molecules to be detected by LuxN and induces the cascade of the system until GFP is expressed. This system would allow shrimp farmers to detect Vibrio parahaemolyticus in their ponds earlier and easier, hence they could do preventive measures to stop WFD.",

To further prove the ability of the DNA nano-structure, this year we used four DNA strands to form a DNA nano-structure to detect the presence and the concentration of Lactobacillus instead of just a gene fragment of a bacterium. We successfully designed nano- triangular bipyramid applicable to the bacterium using Tiamat. We then successfully detect the presence and concentration of bacteria by measuring its peroxidase activity.",

In regards, our team focuses on developing the diagnostic tool using K-12 chimeric bacteria and green fluorescent protein (GFP) to enable a rapid detection of Diphteria toxin upon binding. This novel technology is claimed to be fast, available, and easy-to-usewhich sets stepping stones regarding to the establishment of primary diagnostic tool for Diphtheria toxin worldwide. In addition, we aim to prevent future outbreaks using public education to enhance awareness regarding anti-hoax movements and introduce daily probiotic consumption to encounter low usages of probiotic in Indonesia",

Our members come from different backgrounds, with majors such as chemistry, chemical engineering, biology. However, we have something in common- we all are interested in synthetic biology and admire the concept of iGEM. At first, we were frustrated because of all of the details that need to be carefully accounted for, but after a lot of dedication, we observed that people are suffering HAI(Hospital Acquired Infection) these days. It can`t be denied how crucial the whole environment is to this human being. Therefore, we invented a new product and named it `EcoLife`, with its primary purpose being a air purifier. With this product, we are looking to provide a instrument alternative for those who pursue a healthy life.",
